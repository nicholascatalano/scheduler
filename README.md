# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
My goal with this project was to create a work day scheduler with color coded time blocks depending on the hour of the day. My scheduler also has the ability for you to enter text within the time blocks, and then save that text locally so you can come back to it at any time. The current date will also display at the top of the screen.

#### Install
No install necessary; please visit https://nicholascatalano.github.io/scheduler/ to access.

#### Use
After visiting the above link, you can enter text between each block with a labeled time and the save button. Once text has been entered, click the save button to save your entry. If you refresh or leave the page, coming back to the link provided should result in the text remaining.
